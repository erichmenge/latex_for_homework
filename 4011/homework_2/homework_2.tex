\begin{problem}{1}
  Do Exercise 1.28 parts c from the book.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{2}
  Do Exercise 1.21 part b from the book.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{3}
  Do Problem 1.41 from the book. The most obvious way to solve this problem is by is by showing how to construct a finite automaton accepting the perfect shuffle of A and B from dfas accepting A and B.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{4}
  Do Problem 1.46 parts c from the book.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{5}
  Do Problem 1.47 from the book. You may find it useful to use the fact that regular languages are closed under complementation.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{6}
  Let $\Sigma$ = \{0,1\}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Let A = $\{ 0^ku0^k | k \ge 1$ and $u \in \Sigma^* \}$ Show that A is regular \\
    \item Let B = $\{ 0^k1u0^k | k \ge 1$ and $u \in \Sigma^* \}$. Show that B is not regular.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{7}
  Define the avoids operation on languages A and B to be \\
  \newline\indent avoids(A,B) = $\{ w | w \in$ A and $w$ does not contain any string in B as a substring $\}$ \\
  \newline Prove that the class of regular languages is closed under the avoids operation.
