\begin{problem}{1}
  a. $\{w \in \{a,b\}^*\ |\ \text{w has twice as many bs as as} \}$
  \br
  b. Balanced parentheses and square brackets. Thus, ()(), [][] and (([])[()]) would be legal expressions of this
     language but ([)] and [(()] would not.
  \br
  c.
  \begin{solution}
    a. At first I was tempted to do something like $S \rightarrow bab | bba | abb | A | \epsilon$ but that wouldn't
    allow for long chains such as $aabaabbbbbbb$. \\ So instead it should be $S \rightarrow bSaSb | bSbSa |
    aSbSb|\epsilon$. Which is much like above except it separates each character with $S$ to allow enough flexibility
    for the $\Sigma^*$ requirement.
    \br
    b. $S \rightarrow (S)\ |\ [S]\ |\ \epsilon$
    \br
    c.
  \end{solution}
