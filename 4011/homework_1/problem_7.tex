\begin{problem}{7} Exercise 1.31 from the book. \\

\noindent A language is regular if it is recognized by some finite automaton. \\

\noindent So for $A$ we have some NFA with $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$. \\

\noindent We define $A^R$ to be another NFA with 5-tuple $(Q', \Sigma, \delta', q_0', F')$ where: \\
$Q' = Q$. \\
$\delta'$ is $\delta$ with all transitions reversed. \\
$F'$ is the set of start states of $A$. \\
$q_0'$ is the set of accept states of $A$. \\

\noindent Then the new NFA works the same as the first NFA, only in reverse. \\

\noindent This proves $A^R$ is regular by construction. \\
