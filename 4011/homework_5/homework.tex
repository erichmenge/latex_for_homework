\begin{problem}{1}
  Let $T = \{(i,j,k) | i,j,k \text{ are natural numbers}\}$. Show that T is countable.
  \begin{solution}
    For each pair $(i,j) \in \mathbb{N}$ we can show a correspondence between $(i,j)$ as $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow
    \mathbb{N}$ \\
    See figure ~\ref{fig:problem_1_a}.
    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \caption{$f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$}
      \includegraphics[scale=.5]{problem_1_a.eps}
      \label{fig:problem_1_a}
    \end{figure}
    \noindent Then, if we let each unique pair $(i,j) = a, b, c, \ldots$ we can show a correspondence between those pairs and $k$.\\
    See figure ~\ref{fig:problem_1_b}.
    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \caption{$f: \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$}
      \includegraphics[scale=.5]{problem_1_b.eps}
      \label{fig:problem_1_b}
    \end{figure}
    Because $T$ is onto and one-to-one with $\mathbb{N}$ we can show that these sets are the same size and thus are
    countable.
  \end{solution}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{2}
  Let F be the set of all functions from natural numbers to natural numbers. Using a diagonalization argument, show that
  F is uncountable. Hint: If F is countable, you should be able to list its elements in some order. Use this together
  with a diagonalization argument to derive a contradiction.
  \begin{solution}
    We can assume F is countable and make a table of every function $F$
    \begin{tabular}{ l c r l }
      $f_1(1)$ & $f_1(2)$ & $f_1(3)$ & $\ldots$ \\
      $f_2(1)$ & $f_2(2)$ & $f_2(3)$ & $\ldots$ \\
      $f_3(1)$ & $f_3(2)$ & $f_3(3)$ & $\ldots$ \\
      .\\
      .\\
      .\\
    \end{tabular}
    But then what if we Let $h_i = f_i + k$ where k is a natural number for some f in the table. Clearly $h \subseteq F$
    in the natural numbers, but it violates the sequence in the table. Thus $F$ is uncountable by contradiction.
  \end{solution}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{3}
  Consider the following language: $S = \{<M> | M \text{ is a DFA that accepts } w^R \text{ whenever it accepts w }\}$. Show that S is
  decidable.
  \begin{solution}
    We need to ensure that the reverse of $M$ is equivalent to $M$. We can construct a Turing machine as follows:
    T = ``On input $\tuple{M}$ where M is a DFA:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Create a DFA $M'$ from $M$. Since NFAs and DFAs are equivalent in power we're still maintaining the conditions.\\
      \item Reverse the transition function in $M'$ and make all accept states start states, and vice versa.\\
      \item Ensure there are epsilon transitions so that multiple accept states are now multiple start states.\\
      \item Run $EQ_{DFA}$ (given in the book) on $\tuple{M, DFA(M')}$\\
      \item If $EQ_{DFA}$ accepts, T accepts, if $EQ_{DFA}$ rejects, T rejects.\\
    \end{enumerate}
    ''

    \noindent Since $EQ_{DFA}$ is decidable and decides that $M$ and $M'$ are equal where $M'$ is the reverse of $M$, $S$ is also
    decidable.
  \end{solution}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{4}
  Let $C = \{<G,x> | \text{G is a CFG that generates at least one string that has x as a substring}\}$. Show that C is decidable.
  (Hint: Use properties of context-free languages to change the question to be answered in such a way that you can
  invoke the decider for $E_{CFG}$.)
  \begin{solution}
    The language that has a string with $x$ as a substring is $\Sigma^*x\Sigma^*$.
    We can create a turning machine $T$ to decide $C$.
    T = ``On input \tuple{G, x}:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Let $G'$ be a CFG recognizing $\Sigma^*x\Sigma^* \cap G$\\
      \item Invoke $E_{CFG}$ on CFG $G'$.\\
      \item if $E_{CFG}$ accepts, reject, and vice versa.
    \end{enumerate}
    ''
  \end{solution}
  So we have a CFG $G'$ recognizing the language of $G$ with $x$ as a substring. Running this new CFG through $E_{CFG}$ we
  can determine whether or not this CFG is empty. If it is empty (accept) then we want to reject, if it isn't empty
  (reject) then we accept.  Since $E_{CFG}$ is a decider, and the CFGs are deciders, $T$ is a decider for $C$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{5}
  Let A be a Turing-recognizable language consisting of descriptions of Turing machines $\{<M_1>, <M_2>,...\}$, where
  every $M_i$ is a decider. Prove that some decidable language D is not decided by any decider $M_j$ whose description
  appears in A. (Hint: you may find it helpful to consider an enumerator for A.)
  \begin{solution}
    First create an enumerator $E_A$ for $A$ that enumerates every decider $\{<M_1>, <M_2>,...\}$.
    \br
    Then we can create a decider, that will do the opposite of $M_j$.
    D = ``On input w:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Run string w on the machine $M_j$ in the enumerated list.\\
      \item if $M_j$ accepts, machine T rejects, and vice versa.\\
    \end{enumerate}
    ''\\ So $D$ is a decider because it decides for each $M_j$ is a decider.  But $D \notin E_A$ because for every
    string that causes the machine in $A$ to accept, $D$ will reject, and vice versa. In other words $D$ does not match
    the description of any $M_j$.
  \end{solution}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{6}
  Let C be a language. Prove that C is Turing-recognizable if and only if a decidable language D exists such that $C =
  \{x | \exists y <x,y> \in D\}$. (Hint: For any fixed $n$, is it decidable if a Turing machine accepts a string in (at
  most) $n$ steps?)
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{7 (EC)}
  Consider the language $HALT_{TM} = \{<M,w> | M \text{ is a Turing machine and M halts on w} \}$. We will see that this
  language is not decidable. However, suppose that we are able to somehow provide a decider for this language. (This
  kind of ``magical'' decider is sometimes called an oracle.) Show that we would then be able to provide a decider for
  the language $D = \{<p> | p \text{ s a diophantine equation with integer roots}\}$.
\end{problem}
