\begin{problem}{15.2-3}
  Use the substitution method to show that the solution to the recurrence (15.6) is $\Omega(2^n)$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{15.3-6}
  Imagine that you wish to exchange one currency for another. You realize that instead of directly exchanging one
  currency for another, you might be better off making a series of trades through other currencies, winding up with the
  currency you want. Suppose that you can trade $n$ different currencies, numbered $1, 2, \ldots, n$, where you start
  with currency 1 and wish to wind up with currency $n$. You are given, for each pair of currencies $i$ and $j$ , an
  exchange rate $r_{ij}$, meaning that if you start with $d$ units of currency $i$, you can trade for $dr_{ij}$ units of
  currency $j$. A sequence of trades may entail a commission, which depends on the number of trades you make. Let $c_k$
  be the commission that you are charged when you make $k$ trades. Show that,if $c_k = 0$ for all $k = 1,2
  \dots,n$,then the problem of finding the best sequence of exchanges from currency 1 to currency $n$ exhibits optimal
  substructure. Then show that if commissions ck are arbitrary values, then the problem of finding the best sequence of
  exchanges from currency 1 to currency n does not necessarily exhibit optimal substructure.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{16.1-2}
  Suppose that instead of always selecting the first activity to finish, we instead select the last activity to start
  that is compatible with all previously selected activities. De- scribe how this approach is a greedy algorithm, and
  prove that it yields an optimal solution.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{16.1-3}
  Not just any greedy approach to the activity-selection problem produces a max- imum-size set of mutually compatible
  activities. Give an example to show that the approach of selecting the activity of least duration from among those
  that are compatible with previously selected activities does not work. Do the same for the approaches of always
  selecting the compatible activity that overlaps the fewest other remaining activities and always selecting the
  compatible remaining activity with the earliest start time.
