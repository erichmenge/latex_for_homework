\begin{problem}{9.2-3}
  Write an iterative version of RANDOMIZED-SELECT.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{9.3-3}
  Show how quicksort can be made to run in $O(n \lg n)$ time in the worst case, assuming that all elements are
  distinct.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{9.3-5}
  Suppose that you have a ``black-box'' worst-case linear-time median subroutine. Give a simple, linear-time algorithm
  that solves the selection problem for an arbitrary order statistic.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{9.3-8}
  Let $X[1\ldots n]$ and $Y[1\ldots n$ be two arrays, each containing n numbers already in sorted order. Give an $O(\lg
  n)$-time algorithm to find the median of all $2n$ elements in arrays $X$ and $Y$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{21.3-2}
  Write a nonrecursive version of FIND-SET with path compression.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{21.3-3}
  Give a sequence of $m$ MAKE-SET, UNION, and FIND-SET operations, $n$ of which are MAKE-SET operations, that takes
  $\Omega(m \lg n)$ time when we use union by rank only.
\end{problem}
